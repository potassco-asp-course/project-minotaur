    "# Problem Description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to solve the Minotaur puzzle using ASP.\n",
    "You are in a labyrinth\n",
    "and the goal of the game is to go from a start field to a goal field\n",
    "without being eaten by the Minotaur.\n",
    "The labyrinth has walls, and neither you nor the Minotaur can go through them.\n",
    "At every step you can stay in your current field, or\n",
    "move one field in any direction: up, down, left or right.\n",
    "The Minotaur is faster than you, but luckily he is a bit foolish.\n",
    "He can move two fields every step, but his movements are determined by his and our position: there is no choice for him.\n",
    "He will try to move right or left to become closer to you.\n",
    "If that is not possible, he will try to move up and down to become closer.\n",
    "If this is also not possible, the Minotaur will not move.\n",
    "In this way the Minotaur may move in a step first in one direction (e.g., up) and then in another direction (e.g., left).\n",
    "Typically, to solve a puzzle you have to trap the Minotaur between the walls of the labyrinth,\n",
    "so that you can run free to the goal.\n",
    "You can play the game [here](http://www.janko.at/Spiele/Minotaurus).\n",
    "It is fun and it will help you to get used to the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next figure represents a game with start field ``(2,1)``, \n",
    "goal field ``(3,2)`` \n",
    "and the Minotaur at\n",
    "``(2,3)``.\n",
    "<img width=\"805\" height=\"525\" src=\"img/minotaur.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can scape from the Minotaur and reach the goal\n",
    "with these movements:\n",
    "* Go from the start field ``(2,1)`` to ``(1,1)``.\n",
    "  The Minotaur follows you first to the left and then down to ``(1,2)``.\n",
    "* Now move back to the field ``(2,1)``, and the Minotaur is trapped!\n",
    "  He moves to the right to become closer, going to the field ``(2,2)``,\n",
    "  and then he cannot move any more:\n",
    "  to come closer he would have to move down,\n",
    "  but there is a wall in between.\n",
    "* Now move right to ``(3,1)``\n",
    "  and the Minotaur remains trapped:\n",
    "  he could come closer going right or down, but there are walls there.\n",
    "* Finally you can move up safely to the goal field ``(3,2)``,\n",
    "  while the Minotaur stays at ``(2,2)``.\n",
    "Observe how the Minotaur first tries to shorten the horizontal distance,\n",
    "and only when that is not possible he tries to shorten the vertical gap.\n",
    "If none of these is possible, the Minotaur remains at the same position.\n",
    "The movements of the Minotaur are thus completely deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "You win the game if you move from the initial to the goal field\n",
    "and the Minotaur never moves to the same field where you are."

    "```\n",

    "but it may be shorter, as in the example.\n",
    "We say that a solution is _optimal_ if it goes from ``0`` to ``T``,\n",
